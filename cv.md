## Information
### Goal and priorities
I want to connect my life with IT. I have a specific idea on how to apply IT skills in life. I have had many attempts and now this is another one, but I will see it through to the end. For me, IT is not so much about earning money, but more about a hobby. At least for here and now. But I plan to become a master of my craft in this hobby and monetize this skill. In general, I want to become a programmer, but my main goal is not to make money from it, but to serve people. I have no work experience, I study with great inspiration.
